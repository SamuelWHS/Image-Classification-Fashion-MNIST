# Image-Classification-Fashion-MNIST

Introduction

This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for a deep learning study on image classification.
The project uses the Fashion-MNIST dataset, which consists of 60,000 28x28 grayscale images of 10 fashion categories, along with a test set of 10,000 images.
Through a series of experiments, we systematically investigated how regularization (Dropout), network depth, and hyperparameter tuning impacted model performance and generalization.
